# INSTANT MESSENGER

A java based Instant Messenger which works on multi-threaded client chat server.

Here all the code is based on Java Standard Edition, leveraging core Java libraries for networking, I/O operations, multithreading and GUI development.
Swing GUI Toolkit is extensively used in the client-side code to build  a responsive and interactive graphical interface.
The communication between the server and clients over a network is facilitated by Socket Programming using TCP/IP sockets.
Multithreading is also used to enable concurrent handling of multiple tasks (e.g., managing client connections, GUI updates) to ensure responsiveness and scalability.
